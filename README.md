In this project, I implemented an interactive payment card form that allows users to input data and instantly view updated card details in real-time. I ensured data validation by displaying error messages when form fields were empty or when the card number, expiry date, or CVC fields were in the wrong format. I adapted the page layout to various screen sizes to provide optimal user experience across different devices. Additionally, I introduced visual effects for hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page and I also added the language switcher.
